colorclock
===========

A simple web experiment showing a color clock, depending on the time of the day.

This experiment emerged from a flash idea I had once on a late evening.

It is built upon modern (speak: html5 and es6 and above) web technologies, so it /might/ not work in all browsers.

It uses the "name that color" lib, created by Chirag Mehta - http://chir.ag/projects/ntc.
